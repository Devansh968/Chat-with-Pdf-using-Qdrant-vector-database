# PDF Chat Solution with Langchain and Qdrant
This repository contains the code and documentation for a PDF Chat solution developed using Python. The solution addresses the client's requirements for interactive PDF-based querying, allowing users to ask questions and receive answers directly from PDF documents. The solution leverages Qdrant vector database for efficient embedding management and integrates persistent cloud storage. Additionally, a Langchain RetrievalQA chain has been orchestrated to provide seamless question-answering capabilities. The user interface is built using Streamlit, offering an intuitive web-based GUI for real-time visualization of the PDF Chat through Langchain.
